### Greetings

My name is Pranay Venkatesh. I am an undergraduate student double majoring in chemistry and chemical engineering at BITS Pilani and a Computational Materials Science researcher.


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on organic semiconductors, particularly self-assembly and charge transport.

- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to work on projects in numerical simulations, organic semiconductor materials and devices, electronic structure and charge transport in disordered materials, nano-scale transport and NEMS devices.

- ðŸ‡¦ Linux enthusiast(?) ([I use Arch, btw.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch))
